## Contains FastRelax generated structures:
This directory contains the structures generated using PyRosetta's fastrelax protocol. This finds low-energy backbone and side-chain conformations near a starting conformations by performing many rounds of packing and minimizing, with the repulsive weight in the scoring function gradually increased from a very low value to the normal value from one round to the next.
