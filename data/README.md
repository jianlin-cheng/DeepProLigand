This directory contains the output of running UCSF's Chimera's matchmaker. This ouput is fed into the average program as an input. Here, the predicted structure is superimposed relative to the reference structure.

1. ``7770_superimposed.pdb`` -> Superimposed protein structure of **7770**
2. ``22898_superimposed.pdb`` -> Superimposed protein structure of **22898**
3. ``30210_superimposed.pdb`` -> Superimposed protein structure of **30210**
