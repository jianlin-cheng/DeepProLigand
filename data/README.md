## Contains superimposed structures:
This directory contains the outputs of running UCSF's Chimera's matchmaker function for each protein maps. This ouput is fed into the average program as an input. Here, the predicted structure is superimposed relative to the reference structure.

1. ``7770_superimposed.pdb`` -> Superimposed protein structure of **7770**
2. ``22898_superimposed.pdb`` -> Superimposed protein structure of **22898**
3. ``30210_superimposed.pdb`` -> Superimposed protein structure of **30210**

## Sub directories:
* **averaged directory** contains all the average structure as well as final unrefined protein sturctures submitted to 2021 Ligand Model Challenge
* **refined directory** contains all the refined structures submitted to 2021 Ligand Model Challenge
